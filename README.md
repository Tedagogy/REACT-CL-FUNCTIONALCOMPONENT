# Development server

Run npm start for a dev server. If this command results in error, you might need to run npm install. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the lab instructions. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Running unit tests

If unit tests are present, run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma. If the tests are present and they all pass, the lab is complete!
